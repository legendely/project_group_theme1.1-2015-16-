Cooperation agreement
Working with:
Alex, Pim, Jet, Razv.

Work gets equally divided.

I do not care how or when you do the work if it is finished in time. When you do not finish your work in time, you will have to cook for the whole group. Unless there was a good reason for it, like illness or family problems.

Hand in your work 1 week before deadline so we can discuss together whether it is done right or wrong. 

When someone gets ill he/she will try to do as much work as he/she can. The remainder of the work will be divided in the rest of the group.

When someone doesn’t show up on a meeting and if the reason for that is not legit you will be excused 1 time but second time you will get kicked out of the group.

When someone shows up late without a good excuse he/she will have to cook for the whole group.
